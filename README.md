  ## Installation
  To install a public package, on the command line, run npm install <package_name> This will create the node_modulesdirectory in your current directory (if one doesnt exist yet) and will download the package to that directory. You can check to see if you already have node.js installed by running either the npm -v or the npm version command. Note:If there is no package.jsonfile in the local directory, the latest version of the package is installed.

  ## Usage
  WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
